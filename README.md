# 👋 Hi, I'm Dan Noyes

I'm a Certified Patient Leader and former digital marketing strategist who’s spent the past few years immersed in the intersection of AI and healthcare. After 25+ years leading strategy, I’ve pivoted toward designing empathetic, patient-centered tools that reflect both lived experience and technological insight.

I’m especially interested in how generative AI can close care gaps, improve emotional support, and extend clinical reach—without losing the human touch.

## 🌱 Current Focus

- Creator of **Emma**, an AI emotional support agent for people living with chronic medical conditions
- Exploring ethical, narrative-based applications of AI in healthcare
- Building low-code prototypes to demonstrate real-world use cases that resonate with patients and clinicians alike

## 🧠 Projects

### 🌸 Emma: An Emotional Support Agent for Chronic Care

Emma is a compassion-first AI agent designed to support individuals living with chronic illness. She reinforces CBT-based tools, emotional regulation, and self-advocacy—especially after clinical treatment ends and patients return home to navigate life on their own.

> Emma was inspired by my own lived experience, clinical insights, and the realization that many patients need more than medical facts—they need encouragement, empathy, and reinforcement.
